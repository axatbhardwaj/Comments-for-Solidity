# NatSpec Documentation for Solidity Smart Contracts

NatSpec, or Natural Language Specification, is a documentation format used to write specifications in a human-readable and machine-readable way. It can be used to describe the behavior and functionality of a Solidity smart contract in natural language, making it easier for other developers to understand and use the contract.

### Usage in Solidity smart contracts

To include the NatSpec syntax in your Solidity contract, add the following comment at the beginning of your contract:

```
/// @title MyContract

```

This line will specify the title of your contract and will be used to generate the documentation later on.

Use the `@dev` keyword to add developer-focused comments to your contract. For example:

```
/// @dev This function does something important.

```

This line will specify that the following comment is for developers and is not part of the contract's user-facing documentation.

Use the `@param` keyword to document the parameters of your functions. For example:

```
/// @param _param1 The first parameter.
/// @param _param2 The second parameter.
function myFunction(uint _param1, string _param2) public {}

```

This will document the parameters of the `myFunction` function, making it easier for other developers to understand how to call it.

Use the `@return` keyword to document the return values of your functions. For example:

```
/// @return The sum of a and b.
function myFunction(uint a, uint b) public returns (uint) {
    return a + b;
}

```

This will document what the function returns, making it easier for other developers to understand how to use it.

Use the `@notice` keyword to add user-facing documentation to your contract. For example:

```
/// @notice This function does something useful.
function myFunction() public {}

```

This will add a notice to the function's documentation, making it clear to users what the function does.

Use the `@author` tag to specify the author of the contract:

```
/// @author John Doe

```

This will document the author of the contract.

Use the `@inheritdoc` tag to inherit documentation from a parent contract or interface:

```
interface MyInterface {
    /// @notice This function does something.
    function myFunction() external;
}

contract MyContract is MyInterface {
    /// @inheritdoc MyInterface
    function myFunction() external {}
}

```

This will inherit the documentation of the `myFunction` function from the `MyInterface` interface.

By using these keywords and tags, you can add comprehensive and useful documentation to your Solidity smart contracts, making it easier for other developers to understand and use them.
